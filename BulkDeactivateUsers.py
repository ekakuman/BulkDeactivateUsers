""" Python Script to Delete Users from an Org in Control Hub
    
This script is designed to delete users from a Control Hub organization based on an INPUT CSV file with user emails.
The script is designed to be executed by users with "full admin" role in the org.
Output file called Errors.csv is generated at the end in the same directory as the input CSV file 
(Errors.csv will be empty if the script runs successfully without errors)
Tested with Python version 3.6
The script is limited to only allow 100 users per input file.
If you need to delete more than 100 users then you need to split users into multiple CSV input files or modify the script.

The CSV file should be created using the format from the CSV export from Control Hub.
- Keep the rows of users that should be deleted and REMOVE USERS who should NOT be deleted
- Do not delete the header line, or the first user to delete will be skipped
- Very little validation is done of the input file.  Deleting fields can break this script.
- (The fourth field of each row is the email of the user that will be deleted)
- IMPORTANT:  THE FILE SHOULD ONLY HAVE ENTRIES OF USERS THAT SHOULD BE DELETED

Added functionality to bulk deactivate users.
